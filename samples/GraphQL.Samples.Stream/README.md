# GraphQL @stream Sample

This sample demonstrates the `@stream` directive with Tanka GraphQL, showcasing true asynchronous streaming capabilities using `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` resolvers.

The `@stream` directive is particularly useful for:

- Large lists that take time to fetch
- Paginated data from databases  
- Search results that can be delivered as they're found
- Real-time data feeds from async sources

## What is @stream?

The `@stream` directive allows you to stream items in a list field as they become available, rather than waiting for the entire list to be fetched. This provides:

1. **Faster Initial Response**: Users see the first items immediately
2. **Progressive Loading**: Items appear as they're fetched
3. **Better UX**: Reduced perceived latency for large datasets
4. **Efficient Resource Usage**: Memory-efficient streaming from async sources

## Implementation Features

âœ… **Fully Implemented**: This sample demonstrates working @stream functionality including:

- **True Async Streaming**: Uses `IAsyncEnumerable<Product>` resolvers for genuine streaming
- **HTTP Multipart Responses**: Implements GraphQL-over-HTTP multipart specification
- **Incremental Delivery**: Items are delivered as they become available from the resolver
- **Memory Efficient**: No buffering of entire collections in memory

## Running the Sample

```bash
cd samples/GraphQL.Samples.Stream
dotnet run
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:5241/graphql/ui to access GraphiQL.

## Example Queries

### Basic Product List with @stream

Stream products as they're fetched from the "database":

```graphql
query GetProductsWithStream {
  products(limit: 10) @stream(initialCount: 3) {
    id
    name
    price
    inStock
  }
}
```

This will:
1. Return the first 3 products immediately
2. Stream the remaining 7 products as they become available

### Streaming Search Results

Stream search results as they're found:

```graphql
query SearchWithStream {
  searchProducts(query: "Electronics") @stream(initialCount: 0) {
    id
    name
    description
    price
    category {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Nested Streaming - Product Reviews

Stream reviews for a specific product:

```graphql
query GetProductWithStreamedReviews {
  product(id: "prod-1") {
    id
    name
    price
    
    # Stream reviews as they're fetched
    reviews @stream(initialCount: 2, label: "productReviews") {
      id
      rating
      comment
      author
      createdAt
    }
  }
}
```

### Combining @stream with Field Selection

Stream products with their related products also streamed:

```graphql
query StreamProductsWithRelated {
  products(category: "Electronics", limit: 5) @stream(initialCount: 1, label: "mainProducts") {
    id
    name
    price
    
    # Each product's related items are also streamed
    relatedProducts @stream(initialCount: 0, label: "related") {
      id
      name
      price
    }
  }
}
```

## Response Format

When using `@stream`, the response is delivered as multipart/mixed with incremental payloads:

### Initial Response
```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": [
      { "id": "prod-1", "name": "Electronics Product 1", "price": 299.99 }
    ]
  },
  "hasNext": true
}
```

### Subsequent Chunks
```json
{
  "incremental": [
    {
      "items": [
        { "id": "prod-2", "name": "Electronics Product 2", "price": 499.99 }
      ],
      "path": ["products", 1],
      "label": "mainProducts"
    }
  ],
  "hasNext": true
}
```

### Final Chunk
```json
{
  "incremental": [
    {
      "items": [
        { "id": "prod-5", "name": "Electronics Product 5", "price": 899.99 }
      ],
      "path": ["products", 4]
    }
  ],
  "hasNext": false
}
```

## Implementation Details

The sample uses `IAsyncEnumerable<Product>` to implement true streaming:

```csharp
static async IAsyncEnumerable<Product> GetProducts(string? category, int limit)
{
    // Simulate database query with initial setup time
    await Task.Delay(200);

    var products = GenerateProducts(100);

    // Filter by category if provided
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(category))
    {
        products = products.Where(p => p.Category.Name.Equals(category, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)).ToList();
    }

    // Stream products with per-item latency to simulate real streaming
    foreach (var product in products.Take(limit))
    {
        await Task.Delay(50); // Simulate per-item processing time
        yield return product;
    }
}
```

This allows Tanka GraphQL to:
1. **True Streaming**: Items are streamed as they become available from the resolver
2. **Memory Efficient**: No buffering of entire collections in memory
3. **Cancellation Support**: Enumeration stops if the client disconnects
4. **Backpressure Handling**: Natural async enumeration flow control

## Performance Considerations

- Use `initialCount` to balance between initial response time and number of chunks
- Consider the overhead of each chunk when setting stream parameters
- Monitor the total time for streaming vs. non-streaming responses
- Use labels to identify different streams in the response

## Browser Support

The multipart/mixed responses work with:
- GraphiQL (as demonstrated)
- Apollo Client with multipart support
- Any client that supports the GraphQL multipart response specification
