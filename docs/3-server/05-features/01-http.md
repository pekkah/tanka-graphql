## Http and WebSockets

This sample provides a basic HTTP and WebSockets server with GraphQL schema and query execution.
It supports both GET and POST requests and uses WebSockets for subscriptions. 

WebSockets transport uses the newer [graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) protocol
