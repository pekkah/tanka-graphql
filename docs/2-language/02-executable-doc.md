## Executable Document

Tanka GraphQL splits the GraphQL document into two parts: executable document and type system document.
Executable document is the part of the document that is executed by the GraphQL server. Type system document 
is the part of the document that is used to define the GraphQL schema.

Here's the definition of executable document:

```csharp
#include::xref://src:graphql.language/Nodes/ExecutableDocument.cs
```
