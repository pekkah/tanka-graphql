## Bind resolvers

Resolvers are used to resolve the data for the query. They bind the execution of
GraphQL operation into your logic.

Tanka GraphQL provides few ways of binding resolvers to your schema.

- Bind manually using `SchemaBuilder`
- Bind using resolver maps by using `SchemaBuilder` or `SchemaTools`

### Bind manually using `SchemaBuilder`

```csharp
#include::xref://tutorials:GettingStarted.cs?s=Tanka.GraphQL.Tutorials.GettingStarted.GettingStarted.Part2_BindResolvers_Manual
```

### Bind using `SchemaTools` or `SchemaBuilder`

This approach uses a map of the types and fields to bind resolvers to fields.

NOTE: Binding is done when the method is called.

```csharp
#include::xref://tutorials:GettingStarted.cs?s=Tanka.GraphQL.Tutorials.GettingStarted.GettingStarted.Part2_BindResolvers_SchemaBuilder_Maps
```

This is what you would usually do to bind the resolvers and create schema.
