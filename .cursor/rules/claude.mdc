# Cursor Rules for Tanka GraphQL

## Project Context
Always reference the [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) file at the start of conversations for project-specific guidance, development commands, and architectural patterns.

## Development Guidelines
- Follow the development commands and workflows defined in CLAUDE.md
- Respect the established namespace convention: `Tanka.{ProjectName}`
- Target .NET 9.0 (except GraphQL.Language which is .NET Standard 2.0)
- Use xUnit + NSubstitute for testing, Verify for snapshot testing
- Follow the middleware pipeline architecture for GraphQL execution

## Key Commands (from CLAUDE.md)
- Build: `./build.ps1`
- Build only: `./build.ps1 -OnlyBuild $True`
- Test: `dotnet test -c Release --no-restore --no-build`
- Restore tools: `dotnet tool restore`

## Architecture Awareness
- Core components are in `src/` with clear separation of concerns
- Source generators use snapshot testing in `/Snapshots/` directories
- Apollo Federation support is in `GraphQL.Extensions.ApolloFederation`
- Real-time subscriptions via GraphQL over WebSocket (graphql-ws compatible)
